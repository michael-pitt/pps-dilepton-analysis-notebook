[![SWAN](https://swanserver.web.cern.ch/swanserver/images/badge_swan_white_150.png)](https://cern.ch/swanserver/cgi-bin/go/?projurl=https://github.com/michael-pitt/pps-dilepton-analysis-notebook.git)

To run the notebooks with regular CERN resources:
* Open a [SWAN session](https://swan.cern.ch) (the defaults are good, as of writing this pick software stack 97a and make sure to use Python3)
* In the SWAN session, click on the item on the right-hand side that says "Download Project from git" ![Download Project from git](download_project_trim.png)
* Copy-paste https://github.com/michael-pitt/pps-dilepton-analysis-notebook.git
